# The Out of Band

This document describes how The Out of Band is organized.

## Our Mission

The Out of Band is an infrastructure provider for creative-technical projects that enables people to explore within the domains of Art, Science, and Technology with the intent to create positive social change.

## Roles in The Out of Band

**Facilitators** of the Out of Band are people who do work in or for the space: crafters, leaders of workshops, educators, artists. **Board members** should also be facilitators, meaning that they have interest not only in the Out of Band as a legal entity but also as a resource.

**Everyone** who is part of The Out of Band is partially responsible for maintaining this atmosphere.

**Electrons** of the Out of Band are those who pay dues or have an agreement with the Treasurer in lieu of paying dues, and so have a material investment in the Out of Band. Electrons have powers such as blocking consensus and voting in elections of the board.

**The Board** is the legal interface for the Out of Band. It is responsible for handling legal existential threats to the Out of Band such as: running out of money, paying rent/other bills on time, not getting sued.
