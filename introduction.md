# The Out of Band

This document describes how The Out of Band organizes itself.

## Our Mission

The Out of Band is an infrastructure provider for creative-technical projects that enables people to explore within the domains of Art, Science, and Technology with the intent to create positive social change.

## Roles in The Out of Band

**Facilitators** of the Out of Band are people who do work in or for the space: crafters, leaders-of-workshops, educators, artists. Board members should also be facilitators (?) meaning that they have interest not only in the OOB as a legal entity, but also as the resource it provides.

**Everyone** who is part of The Out of Band is partially responsible for maintaining this atmosphere.

**The Board** acts as a legal barrier between The Out of Band and legal realities. They make sure taxes are good. In case of emergency, they can reboot The Out of Band.

**Electrons** are those who pay dues (or have an agreement with the Treasurer in lieu of dues) and have a material investment in the OOB. The Electrons have powers like blocking in consensus decisions and voting in the Board elections.
