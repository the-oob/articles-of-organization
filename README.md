# The Out of Band

This document describes how The Out of Band organizes itself.

## Our Mission

The Out of Band is an infrastructure provider for creative-technical projects that enables people to explore within the domains of Art, Science, and Technology with the intent to create positive social change.

## Roles in The Out of Band

**Facilitators** of the Out of Band are people who do work in or for the space: crafters, leaders of workshops, educators, artists, to name a few. They do the work to make it happen; not because they need to, but because they want to. In exchange, facilitators of The Out of Band are enriched through the creative energy they foster and the community that is cultivated by us all.

**Everyone** who is part of The Out of Band is partially responsible for maintaining this atmosphere. All who enter are guardians of the space and it is our collective responsibility to keep it positive and going forward.

**Members** of the Out of Band are those who pay dues or have an agreement with the Treasurer in lieu of paying dues, and so have a material investment in the Out of Band. Members have two limited powers: blocking consensus and voting in elections of the board. In all other aspects, the value of membership in The Out of Band is for you to determine. It isn't required to use or even contribute to the space; membership can be applied for but it is only granted by consensus.

**Functionaries** of the Out of Band are voluntary roles taken on by willing members and intended to change regularly. They are the people charged with the responsibilities of keeping the space alive. The list of functionaries is maintained by the secretary and acts as a balance against the "tyrany of structurelessness" that might come about in a non-hiearchial organization such as The Out of Band. In most anarchist groups, "nobody" is in charge except for the people who are actually in charge. Functionaries is our way of making the invisible hiearchy visible; everyone knows who is responsible for the critical space functions while at the same time we don't limit who can take on those responsibilities.

**The Board** is the legal interface for the Out of Band. It is responsible for handling legal existential threats to the Out of Band such as: running out of money, paying rent/other bills on time, not getting sued, and the like. The board should be as hands-off as possible, since **Everyone** makes The Out of Band what it is. Board members should also be facilitators, meaning that they have interest not only in the Out of Band as a legal entity but also as a resource. Being on the board means no additional power over the space; it means that you're putting your time and energy on the line to make sure The Out of Band stays legal.
