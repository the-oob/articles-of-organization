# Code of Conduct

This is a living document that describes how we're building The Out of Band. It is a guideline as to who we're looking for. It was originally consensed to on March 10, 2016.

We the hackers of The Out of Band do value:

Pragmatism, Love, Diversity, Mutability, Collaboration, Access, Boundaries.

- Pragmatism over Utopianism
 - Some things will never be done. Working is better than perfect.
- Love within and without
 - We're excellent to each other here. Feelings are important. We're making a safer space in the world.
- Diversity
 - Privilege and systemic oppression are real. We need to be inclusive of more than just straight white guys.
- Access, mutability, and transparency over exclusivity
 - Everyone should feel empowered to use The Out of Band. Everyone should know how The Out of Band works. Everyone should feel empowered to change things how they see fit to accomplish our goals.
- Collaboration over isolation and competition
 - The Out of Band is an incubator of ideas. Big ideas won't come from just one person. We need to help out each other and be able to accept that help graciously.
- Boundaries
 - All are welcome to come to The Out of Band; not all are welcome to stay. We have a right to define where that line is.

As such, we are committed to upholding these values. In particular, the following code of conduct applies within our community:

- The OOB is a friendly, safe, welcoming environment for all, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other similar characteristic.
- Please avoid using overtly sexual nyms or other nyms that might detract from a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all.
- Please be kind and courteous. There's no need to be mean or rude.
- Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every decision carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a right answer.
- Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you want to experiment with, be prepared to do the work yourself.
- We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean, or harass anyone. That is not welcome behaviour. We interpret the term "harassment" as including the definition in the Citizen Code of Conduct; if you have any lack of clarity about what might be included in the concept, please read their definition. In particular, we don't tolerate behavior that excludes people in socially marginalized groups.
- Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if you feel you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a community member, please contact the Community Working Group immediately. Whether you're a regular contributor or newcomer, we care about making this community a safe place for you and we've got your back.
- Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or other attention-stealing behaviour is not welcome.

To render this code of conduct effective, the Out of Band has a group of volunteers pledged to uphold it. This group is called the Community Working Group.

The Community Working Group follows these policies for upholding our community's standards of conduct. If you feel that something needs attention, please contact the Community Working Group.

- Remarks that violate The Out of Band standards of conduct, including hateful, hurtful, oppressive, or exclusionary remarks, are not allowed. Cursing is allowed by never targeting another user and never in a hateful manner.
- Remarks that the CWG find inappropriate, whether listed in the CoC or not, are also not allowed.
- CWG will first respond to such remarks with a warning
- If the warning is unheeded, the person will be asked to step away from The Out of Band to cool off.
- If they come back and continue to make trouble, they will be banned i.e., indefinitely excluded.
- The CWG may choose at its discretion to un-ban the person if it was a first offense and they offer the offended party a genuine apology.
- If the CWG bans someone and you think it was unjustified, please take it up with that CWG member, or with a different CWG member, in private. Public complaints about bans are not allowed.
- CWG members are held to a higher standard than other community members. If a CWG member creates an inappropriate situation, they should expect less leeway than others.
