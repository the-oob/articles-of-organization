# The Out of Band

This document describes how The Out of Band is organized.

## Our Mission

The Out of Band is an infrastructure provider for creative-technical projects that enables people to explore within the domains of Art, Science, and Technology with the intent to create positive social change.

## Roles in The Out of Band

**Facilitators** are the people responsible for the space being a place where cool shit can happen.

**Everyone** who is part of The Out of Band is partially responsible for maintaining this atmosphere.
