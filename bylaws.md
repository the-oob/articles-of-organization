# Purpose
*List a few things we do, copied from other bylaws*
*Ex.: To accomplish our mission, the Out of Band provides: safe [and comfortable?] physical/virtual space for workshops, classes, and forums; tools for physical/virtual crafting, and training to use these tools safely and effectively;*
*Is “comfortable” space necessarily something we’re aiming for? Some people are made uncomfortable by having their views challenged, and I think that a space that supports art shouldn't necessarily aim for comfort. Also, “safe” to me is sort of a loaded term, because it raises the question: safe for whom, and in what ways?*
## Limitation on Activities
The activities of the Corporation shall be performed in service to and with guidance of the community of participants. Notwithstanding any other provisions of these Articles, the Corporation shall not carry on any activities not permitted to be carried on by a corporation exempt from federal income tax under Section 501(c)(3) of the Code.

# Values
We the hackers of The Out of Band do value:

**Pragmatism, Love, Diversity, Mutability, Collaboration, Access, Boundaries.**

* **Pragmatism over Utopianism**: Some things will never be done. Working is better than perfect.
* **Love within and without**: We're excellent to each other here. Feelings are important. We're making a safer space in the world.
* **Diversity**: Privilege and systemic oppression are real. We need to be inclusive of more than just straight white guys.
* **Access, mutability, and transparency over exclusivity**: Everyone should feel empowered to use The Out of Band. Everyone should know how The Out of Band works. Everyone should feel empowered to change things how they see fit to accomplish our goals.
* **Collaboration over isolation and competition**: The Out of Band is an incubator of ideas. Big ideas won't come from just one person. We need to help out each other and be able to accept that help graciously.
* **Boundaries**: All are welcome to come to The Out of Band; not all are welcome to stay. We have a right to define where that line is.

As such, we are committed to upholding these values.

No director of this corporation nor any other corporation, firm, association, or other entity in which one or more of this corporation's directors are directors or have a material financial interest, shall be interested, directly or indirectly, in any contract or transaction with this corporation, unless (a) the material facts regarding that director's financial interest in such contract or transaction or regarding such common directorship, officership, or financial interest are fully disclosed in good faith and noted in the minutes, or are known to all members of the board prior to the board's consideration of such contract or transaction; (b) such contract or transaction is authorized in good faith by a majority of the board by a vote sufficient for that purpose without counting the votes of the interested directors; (c) before authorizing or approving the transaction, the board considers and in good faith decides after reasonable investigation that the corporation could not obtain a more advantageous arrangement with reasonable effort under the circumstances; and (d) the corporation for its own benefit enters into the transaction, which is fair and reasonable to the corporation at the time the transaction is entered into.

This Section does not apply to a transaction that is part of an educational or charitable program of this corporation if it (a) is approved or authorized by the corporation in good faith and without unjustified favoritism and (b) results in a benefit to one or more directors or their families because they are in the class of persons intended to be benefited by the educational or charitable program of this corporation.

#Loans to Directors and Officers
This corporation shall not lend any money or property to or guarantee the obligation of any director or officer without the approval of the California Attorney General, provided, however, that the corporation may advance money to a director or officer of the corporation for expenses reasonably anticipated to be incurred in the performance of his or her duties if that director or officer would be entitled to reimbursement for such expenses by the corporation.

#Indemnification
To the fullest extent permitted by law, this corporation shall indemnify its directors, officers, employees, and other persons described in Corporations Code section 5238(a), including persons formerly occupying any such positions, against all expenses, judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred by them in connection with any "proceeding," as that term is used in that section, and including an action by or in the right of the corporation, by reason of the fact that the person is or was a person described in that section. "Expenses," as used in this bylaw, shall have the same meaning as in that section of the Corporations Code. On written request to the board by any person seeking indemnification under Corporations Code section 5238(b) or section 5238(c) the board shall promptly decide under Corporations Code section 5238(e) whether the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Corporations Code section 5238(b) or section 5238(c) has been met and, if so, the board shall authorize indemnification. If the board cannot authorize indemnification, because the number of directors who are parties to the proceeding with respect to which indemnification is sought prevents the formation of a quorum of directors who are not parties to that proceeding, the board shall promptly call a meeting of members. At that meeting, the members shall determine under Corporations Code section 5238(e) whether the applicable standard of conduct has been met and, if so, the members present at the meeting in person or by proxy shall authorize indemnification.

To the fullest extent permitted by law and except as otherwise determined by the board in a specific instance, expenses incurred by a person seeking indemnification under Article 11 of these bylaws in defending any proceeding covered by that Section shall be advanced by the corporation before final disposition of the proceeding, on receipt by the corporation of an undertaking by or on behalf of that person that the advance will be repaid unless it is ultimately found that the person is entitled to be indemnified by the corporation for those expenses.
