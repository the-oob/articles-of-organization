# Name
The Name of this corporation is The Out of Band
# Mission
The Out of Band is an infrastructure provider for creative-technical projects that enables people to explore within the domains of Art, Science, and Technology with the intent to create positive social change.
# Purpose
*List a few things we do, copied from other bylaws*
*Ex.: To accomplish our mission, the Out of Band provides: safe [and comfortable?] physical/virtual space for workshops, classes, and forums; tools for physical/virtual crafting, and training to use these tools safely and effectively;*
*Is “comfortable” space necessarily something we’re aiming for? Some people are made uncomfortable by having their views challenged, and I think that a space that supports art shouldn't necessarily aim for comfort. Also, “safe” to me is sort of a loaded term, because it raises the question: safe for whom, and in what ways?*
